[Stylus](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne) is an extension that lets you change the css of a webpage. If you need larger text you can add it to your browser and change the site by force.

> Click on the extension > Manage > Actions: Write new style

> Under "Code 1:" click the dropdown and change it from "everything" to "URLs starting with" and put `https://character.ai/` in the text box to the right of the 
> dropdown. If your still using the old site you might need to change this to whatever URL the home page is.

> Paste this into the code area 
`.mt-1 p {
    font-size: 22px !important;
}

.text-small {
    font-size: 22px !important;
}`

> Click save

Should work once you reload c.ai and obv you can adjust 22px to be whatever size you need.
